## Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
Assign the value 16 to a variable a.
Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.
Print the result.
## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```
## Output

## Result
Thus,the Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is created successfully.

## Functions in Python: Modulo Calculator
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their modulo using the % operator.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
Define a function called result that takes two arguments a and b.
Inside the function, compute the modulo using a % b.
Print the result of the modulo operation.
Get two integer inputs from the user.
Call the result function with the user-provided values.
## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
def result(a, b):
    modulo_value = a % b
    return modulo_value

a=int(input())
b=int(input())
print("modulo is", result(a, b))
```
## Output
438317774-c7fade8a-0d6a-4138-b796-cf2f2d7398ba

## Result
Thus,the Python program that defines a function which accepts two values and returns their modulo using the % operator is created successfully.
