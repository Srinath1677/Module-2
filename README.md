## Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python
## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
Assign the value 16 to a variable a.
Use the built-in bin() function to convert the number to binary.
Print the result.
## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=16
y=bin(x)
print(y)
```
## Output
438317251-2e985875-d209-49d9-ad9e-5bb5b133ae3b

## Result
Thus,the Python program to convert the number 16 into its binary representation using built-in Python functions is created successfully.
